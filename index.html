                It’s a dark and windy night. Your eyes are heavy.<br>
                You’ve been slugging through this coding project for weeks.<br>
                It’s almost done, but there’s one little bug in the code<br>
                you just can’t figure out. You know your mentor, Jordan,<br>
                would tell you to just take a break already, but you swear<br>
                you’re about to find it if you just go over it one more time-<br>
                <br>
                ZAP!<br>
                <br>
                The power just went out...<br>
                You're left staring incredulously at your blank computer screen.<br>
                As your eyes adjust, you hear something...<br>
                Something that had been covered up by the sounds of your school before…<br>
                is that screaming? It is!<br>
                You look out the window. Dozens of androids attacking your classmates in the<br>
                school courtyard. But Jordan created androids to be peaceable, didn’t he?<br>
                Why is this happening?<br>
                <br>
                You have no time to think. Already, you can see the fight taking everyone<br>
                closer to the school. If the androids are becoming homicidal, you know<br>
                it won’t be long before they raid the building.<br>
                <br>
                Quick! Should you:<br>
                <br>
                Barricade yourself in the classroom, or try to run and escape in the chaos?
